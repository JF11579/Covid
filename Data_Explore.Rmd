This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

#Resources

#Plans
convert to date type
make data skinny.
mutate import county pop
get per capita infection and death rates.
get population density per sq mile.
merge demographics : age, do all counties have same male/female ratio?  income

```{r}
#PACKAGES
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(lubridate)
```

```{r}
getwd()
```

```{r}
NYS_Covid_Data <- read_csv("NYS_Statewide_COVID-19_Testing.csv")
```

```{r}
head(NYS_Covid_Data,3)
```

```{r}
dim(NYS_Covid_Data)
```


```{r}
str(NYS_Covid_Data)
```

```{r}
#convert Test Date from character to date type
NYS_Covid_Data$Test_Date <- as.Date(NYS_Covid_Data$Test_Date , format= "%m/%d/%Y")

```

```{r}
head(NYS_Covid_Data)
```

Add population data from the Census
```{r}
county_pop <- read_csv("NY_counties.csv")
```


```{r}
dim(county_pop)
```

Since there is only a single row we are intersted in let us filter this down.
Each county has many rows, age groups , but  AGEGRP = 0 is
the total population for that county
```{r}
pop <- county_pop%>%
          filter(AGEGRP==0) %>%
              select(c(CTYNAME, TOT_POP, AGEGRP))
```

```{r}
head(pop)
```
```{r}
dim(pop)
```

```{r}
head(pop,10)
```

```{r}
pop <- pop%>%
          group_by(CTYNAME)%>%
            top_n(n=1 ,wt=TOT_POP)
```


```{r}
head(pop)
```

Make col names uniform
new col anme = exisitng col name
```{r}
pop <- pop %>% 
          rename(County = CTYNAME)
``` 

```{r}
head(pop,3)
```

Next remove the word COUNTY from the name of each county.
use SEPARATE
```{r}
pop<- pop%>%
          separate(County, c("County", NA))       #df %>% separate(x, c("a", NA))
```


```{r}
head(pop)   
```

```{r}
head(NYS_Covid_Data)
```


Next join the two datasets on the county name.
```{r}
pop_and_count <- full_join(NYS_Covid_Data,pop, by ="County")
```

```{r}
View(pop_and_count)
```


Lets add teh dasys of the week to our Df
```{r}
pop_and_count<- pop_and_count %>%
mutate(day_week = wday(Test_Date,label = TRUE))
```

Now let us look at every Monday
```{r}
pop_and_count<-filter(pop_and_count, day_week == "Mon")
```


```{r}
View(pop_and_count)
```

########3



```{r}
pop1<- pop1 %>%
mutate(day_week = wday(Test_Date,label = TRUE))
```

```{r}
View(pop1)
```

```{r}
pop2<-filter(pop1, day_week == "Mon")
```

```{r}
View(pop2)
```
