## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r}
p_and_c<- read_csv("Pop_And_Count.csv")
```



Lets add the days of the week to our Df
```{r}
p_and_c<- p_and_c %>%
mutate(day_week = wday(Test_Date,label = TRUE))
```

Now let us look at every Monday
```{r}
p_and_c<-filter(p_and_c, day_week == "Mon")
```


```{r}
View(p_and_c)
```

```{r}
B1<- ggplot(p_and_c,aes(x=p_and_c$County, y= p_and_c$Cumulative_Number_of_Positives))+
      geom_bar(stat = "identity")+
  coord
B1
```

```{r}
L1<- ggplot(p_and_c, aes(x=p_and_c$County  ,y=p_and_c$Cumulative_Number_of_Positives))+
      geom_line()+coord_flip()
L1
```


```{r figl, fig.height=5, fig.width=4}
L2<- ggplot(p_and_c, aes(x=p_and_c$County  ,y=p_and_c$Cumulative_Number_of_Positives))+
      geom_line()+coord_flip()
L2
```
